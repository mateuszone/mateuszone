- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mateuszone
I'm online tutor in python/django, feel free to msg me :)

Software Engineer with 1-year experience and additional 1 year as an IT junior. Excited to grow my skills in App development and R&D technologies.
Python is my primary language but i know basics of Js and C. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Django and React.
Showing people how to code gives me a huge satisfaction, I teach python up to intermediate topics and basics of django and SQL in purpose to pass exams or get first job.
